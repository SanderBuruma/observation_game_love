# Game Goal
Click any circle of the color which is the most prevalent

# Random ideas
- Circles move away from the cursor while the cursor is over them
- Googly eyes on the circles
- Color blind adaptability by making colors so that they are different shades to the colorblind
- Background

## modifiers
- Limited Vision
- Shifting colors (in and out of greyscale)
- One bean is removed from a random color which isn't the max. Clicking that bean resets the level
